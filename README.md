Instructions:

Create a small web app that will show the approximate distance in Km from the user's current
location to a point of interest nearby, which will be specified by submitting its address. A
history of recent destinations is kept by the application and the user is able to search the history.

Notes:

- needs to work in HTML5 capable browsers only and preferably the layout will be adaptive;
- you can use the Google Geocoding API to covert addresses in the geographical coordinates and vice versa.
